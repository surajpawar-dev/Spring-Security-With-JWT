## Overview

The **Auth Service** is a robust, production-ready authentication and authorization microservice built on Spring Boot. It provides secure user management with JWT-based authentication and fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC). Designed to be both scalable and adaptable, it can serve as a standalone authentication service or integrate with other microservices in a distributed system architecture.
